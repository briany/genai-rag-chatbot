This is a test document for the GenAI RAG Chatbot.

It contains some sample information about artificial intelligence and machine learning.

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique that combines information retrieval with text generation. It allows language models to access and use external knowledge when generating responses.

Key benefits of RAG include:
- Improved accuracy by grounding responses in factual information
- Up-to-date information without retraining the model
- Transparency through source attribution
- Reduced hallucinations

The system works by:
1. Splitting documents into chunks
2. Creating embeddings for each chunk
3. Storing embeddings in a vector database
4. Retrieving relevant chunks for user queries
5. Using retrieved context to generate informed responses
