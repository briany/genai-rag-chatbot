# Machine Learning Guide

## What is Machine Learning?

**Machine Learning** (ML) is a subset of *artificial intelligence* that enables computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

### Key Concepts

1. **Supervised Learning**: Uses labeled training data
2. **Unsupervised Learning**: Finds patterns in unlabeled data  
3. **Reinforcement Learning**: Learns through trial and error

### Popular Algorithms

- **Linear Regression**: For predicting continuous values
- **Decision Trees**: For classification and regression
- **Neural Networks**: For complex pattern recognition
- **Random Forest**: Ensemble method combining multiple trees

> "The goal is to create models that can make accurate predictions on new, unseen data."

### Code Example

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Create and train a model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
```

### Benefits

| Advantage | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Automation | Reduces manual work |
| Accuracy | Can find complex patterns |
| Scalability | Handles large datasets |

**Important**: Always validate your models with proper train/test splits to avoid overfitting.
